AppIds:

#Additional AppIds to inject (Overrides OwnerIds for apps you got shared! This breaks downloads)
#Best to use this only on games NOT in your library.
#AppIds on this list will automatically get added to your AppIds setting aswell, but only for the initial check.
#It will get ignored in exclusion checks for the parent AppId
AdditionalApps:

#Extra Data for Dlcs belonging to a specific AppId. Only needed
#when the App you're playing is hit by Steams 64 DLC limit
DlcData:

#Used to retrieve ProductInfo from Steam servers for some games
AppTokens:

#Legacy CD keys required by some games
#Unless explicitly specified SLSsteam will generate a random 4 * 4 key using A-Z + 0-9 seeded by your accountId + appId
#If you want to delete injected CD keys delete cdk_[number] from your localconfig.vdf

SteamIdOverride:
